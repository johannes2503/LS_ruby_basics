# Part 2

a = 7

  a += 10

my_value(a)
puts a

# Answer  = 7
# - This problem is identical to the previous problem. The only thing we did is change the name b to a. Note that we can do this because method definitions are self-contained with respect to local variables. 
# Local variables outside the method definition are not visible inside the method definition; so the top level a is not available inside my_value.
# Furthermore, local variables inside the method definition are not visible outside the method definition; so the a inside my_value is a local variable with no top-level visibility.
