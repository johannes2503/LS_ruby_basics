# Answer  = `my_value': undefined local variable or method `a' for main:Object (NameError)

# - Even though a is defined before my_value is defined, it is not visible inside my_value. Method definitions are self contained with respect to local variables. 
# Local variables initialized inside the method definition are not visible outside the method definition, and local variables initialized outside the method definition are not visible inside the method definition.

# Note, however, that local variables will be visible (via closures) inside blocks, procs, and lambdas.
