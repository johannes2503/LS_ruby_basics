a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |a|
  a += 1
end

puts a

# Answer = 7

# This problem demonstrates shadowing. Shadowing occurs when a block parameter hides a local 
# variable that is defined outside the block. Since the outer a is shadowed, 
# the a += 1 has no effect on it. In fact, that statement has no effect at all.
